     <strong>Objective</strong> is to extract meaning data from the target text then store the result and source file .Text sources are numerous these days. Starting with simple website to complicated APIs, and varied file format. Processing the text in the client side has <strong>Two major downside</strong>. The file and the data extracted is lost after the session.

            <h3>Why not use just Browser?</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
              This page has been served from a <strong>remote server</strong>. The <strong>user i.e you</strong> care, feel and 
              want to experience is a smooth operation of the web page. This is page has a purpose. It is to act as a memory hook,
              a reminder about conceptual difference between server-side and user-side javascript. 
            </p>
            <h3>There are Differences</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">The webpage that is shown to the user need not contain any JavaScript. Webpage that we 
              build on a file like index.html is <strong>not required.</strong>. The entire page is built on the server and 
              it is transported to the web browser of the user. 
            </p>
            <button id="geoLocate">GeoLocate me!</button>
            
            <h3>Your location shown</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy" id="youLoc"></p>
            <script>
              var geo = document.getElementById('geoLocate')
              var x = document.getElementById('youLoc')
              function getLocation() {
                console.log('enter')
                if (navigator.geolocation) {
                  navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition);
                } else {
                  x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
                }
              }
              
              function showPosition(position) {
                console.log(position)
                x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
                "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
              }
              
              geo.addEventListener('click',getLocation)
            </script>
            <h3>How about this page?</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">It is a static page with inbuilt script sent to the browser. Browser is seeing it, as <strong>whole page</strong>. The <strong>Geolocate</strong> button above shows the location after getting your permission.</p>
            <h3>What difference does it make?</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">To the regular consumer of websites, it opens up aesthetically pleasing pages, with functions 
              that is supported from the server. Especially the security is enhanced, as the user credentials are stored in the 
              server. Multiple front-end frameworks are created for the developers to build websites fast. For example, provide any of the 
              english "Parts of Speech" in the below text box. This <strong>queries the server</strong> that the page is hosted and provides the data. 
            </p>
            <input type="pos" id="pos"/>
            <button id="getCol">Part of Speech</button>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy" id="color"><span>The color associated is: </span></p>
            <script>
              var enter = document.getElementById('getCol');
              var output = document.getElementById('color');

              enter.addEventListener('click', getColorData)

              function getColorData(){
                var text = document.getElementById('pos').value;
                let capText = text.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + text.slice(1)
                if(text == ''){
                  output.innerHTML = '';
                  output.innerHTML += "<span class='bg-red'>Provide a Parts of speech like Noun or Verb...</span>"
                } else {
                  const root = "/all"; 
                  console.log(root)
                  output.textContent = ''
                  fetch(root)
                    .then(data=>data.json())
                    .then(color=>{
                      //console.log(color)
                      for(let col of color){
                        if(col.description == capText){
                        output.innerHTML += `<span class='bg-${col.color}'>The ${col.description} has tag ${col.tag}</span><br>`;
                      }
                    }
                  })
                }
              }
            </script>
            <h3>Hey, I am unable to scrape this Page!!!</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">Scraping is the activity of selectively pulling the information of the 
              webpage, and storing it for later use. <strong>Scraper is not a browser</strong>. Page only comes in if a browser 
              requests for it. The page is rendered like a movie on the theatre screen. If there is no screen, then how to see and then 
              scrape it?   
            </p>
            <h3>How to send input to Server?</h3>
            <strong>On Page Input</strong> The page can be rendered with elements from which the user input can be requested, and then processed on the server-side. 
            The output can be sent back to the page. <strong>On URL input</strong> The url that is entered into the address bar is modified to include the 
            input from the user. Many API's work using the url modification process. Querying these APIs can be done through requests libraries in Python on Javascript. 
            <h3>Why learn server side programming?</h3>
            <strong>Knowledge about sending</strong> the pages piece-wise to the browser opens up new technologies and frameworks which were not 
              available when the page had to be sent as a full file. The libraries like Express, Svelte, React and Angular are the mutation of 
              the server-side scripting. It is a mandatory launchpad to lift off into the Front-End world.
            <h3>How the Page style works?</h3>
            <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">That is, the server sends the stylesheet to the user. This page is styled with <a href="http://tachyons.io/#style">Tachyons CSS</a>. If you check the source of the page,
            the style sheet itself has come along from the server.</p>
