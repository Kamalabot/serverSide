              <h3>Webpages are in the Interwebs</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
                This page has been served from a <strong>remote server</strong>. The <strong>user i.e you</strong> care the least or even 
                understand what is server side programming or client side programming. What you know, feel and 
                want to experience is a smooth operation of the web page. This is page has a purpose, and that is to act as a memory hook,
                a reminder about conceptual difference between server-side and user-side javascript. 
              </p>
              <h3>What is one Major Difference</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">The webpage that is shown to the user need not contain any JavaScript. Webpage that we 
                build on a file like index.html is <strong>not required.</strong>. The entire page is built on the server and 
                it is transported to the web browser of the user. 
              </p>
              <h3>How about this page?</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">It is a static page sent to the browser you are seeing it, as <strong>whole page</strong></p>
              <h3>What difference does it make?</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">To the regular consumer of websites, it opens up aesthetically pleasing pages, with functions 
                that is supported from the server. Especially the security is enhanced, as the user credentials are stored in the 
                server, and the security of the server much higher than that of the user.
              </p>
              <h3>Hey, I am unable to scrape this Page!!!</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">Scraping is the activity of selectively pulling the information of the 
                webpage, and storing it for later use. <strong>Scraper is not a browser</strong>. Page only comes in if a browser 
                requests for it. The page is rendered like a movie on the theatre screen. If there is no screen, then how to see and then 
                scrape it?   
              </p>
              <h3>How to send input to Server?</h3>
              <strong>On Page Input</strong> The page can be rendered with elements from which the user input can be requested, and then processed on the server-side. 
              The output can be sent back to the page. <strong>On URL input</strong> The url that is entered into the address bar is modified to include the 
              input from the user. Many API's work using the url modification process. Querying these APIs can be done through requests libraries in Python on Javascript. 
              <h3>Why learn server side programming?</h3>
              <strong>Knowledge about sending</strong> the pages piece-wise to the browser opens up new technologies and frameworks which were not 
                available when the page had to be sent as a full file. The libraries like Express, Svelte, React and Angular are the mutation of 
                the server-side scripting. It is a mandatory launchpad to lift off into the Front-End world.
              <h3>How the Page style works?</h3>
              <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">That is, the server sends the stylesheet to the user. This page is styled with <a href="http://tachyons.io/#style">Tachyons CSS</a>. If you check the source of the page,
              the style sheet itself has come along from the server.</p>
